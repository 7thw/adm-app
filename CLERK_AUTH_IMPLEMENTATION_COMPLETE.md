# Realigna Admin App - Clerk Token Authentication Implementation Complete

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

### Changes Made:

#### 1. **Updated Convex Media Functions**
- ✅ Replaced all `requireAdmin` calls with `requireAdminClerk`
- ✅ Removed dependency on adminUsers table
- ✅ All media functions now use Clerk token validation

#### 2. **Enhanced Middleware**
- ✅ Added admin validation at route level
- ✅ Checks both email (adm-realigna@7thw.com) and Clerk metadata role
- ✅ Redirects non-admin users to access denied page

#### 3. **Updated Frontend**
- ✅ Added admin validation in media page component
- ✅ Removed AdminSetup component dependency
- ✅ Added proper loading and error states

#### 4. **Created Access Control**
- ✅ Created `/access-denied` page for unauthorized users
- ✅ Added admin setup utility script

## 🚀 How to Use:

### Step 1: Set Admin User (One-time setup)
1. Make sure `adm-realigna@7thw.com` has signed up and created an account
2. Optionally set metadata in Clerk Dashboard or use the script

### Step 2: Test Access
1. Sign in with `adm-realigna@7thw.com`
2. Access `/dashboard/medias`
3. Should now have full media upload functionality

### Step 3: Test Non-Admin (Optional)
1. Sign in with any other email
2. Should be redirected to access denied page

## 🔧 Admin User Configuration:

The system recognizes admin users through:
1. **Email Match**: `adm-realigna@7thw.com` (hardcoded)
2. **Clerk Metadata**: `publicMetadata.role === "admin"`

To set additional admin users via Clerk metadata:
```typescript
// In Clerk Dashboard or via API
{
  "publicMetadata": {
    "role": "admin"
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved:

- ✅ **Simplified Architecture**: No more adminUsers table dependency
- ✅ **Centralized Auth**: All admin validation through Clerk
- ✅ **Security**: Admin validation at middleware level
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for admin status
- ✅ **Scalability**: Easy to add more admin users

## 🧪 Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Admin user can access `/dashboard/medias`
- [ ] Admin user can upload media files
- [ ] Admin user can view media table
- [ ] Non-admin users get access denied
- [ ] Middleware properly redirects unauthorized users
- [ ] Convex functions properly validate admin status

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

If admin access is denied:
1. Verify email is exactly `adm-realigna@7thw.com`
2. Check Clerk user account exists
3. Check browser console for auth logs
4. Verify Clerk environment variables are set
