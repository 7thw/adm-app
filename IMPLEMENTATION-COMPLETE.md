```

## 🎯 Key Business Rules Enforced

1. **Draft/Published Workflow**: Published playlists cannot be edited until unpublished
2. **Section Types**: Base sections play once, Loop sections repeat with playlist cycles
3. **Media Selection Limits**: Min/max controls for subscriber customization
4. **Admin-Only Access**: All administrative functions require admin authentication
5. **Real-time Updates**: Changes sync instantly across all connected clients

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. **Database Setup**
```bash
# Start Convex development
npx convex dev

# Set up default categories (run once)
# Go to Convex Dashboard → Functions → playlistCategoriesSetup:setupDefaultCategories
# Click "Run" to create default categories
```

### 2. **Authentication**
- Ensure you're logged in as admin user: `adm-realigna@7thw.com`
- Admin access is controlled via Clerk metadata and email verification

### 3. **Testing the System**
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/core-playlists`
2. Create a new playlist (will be in "draft" status)
3. Add sections with different types (base/loop)
4. Add media to sections from your media library
5. Configure media selection limits
6. Publish the playlist when ready

## 🚀 Advanced Features Ready for Implementation

### 1. **Drag-and-Drop Ordering**
- Structure is ready for @dnd-kit integration
- Sort handlers are prepared in components
- Reorder mutations are implemented in Convex

### 2. **Media Preview**
- Audio/video playback integration points are ready
- Media player hooks can be easily added
- Thumbnails and metadata display is implemented

### 3. **Enhanced Filtering**
- Search functionality is implemented
- Category filtering is ready
- Status-based filtering is available

## 📊 Database Schema Integration

The implementation properly uses the schema from the PRD:

```typescript
// All entities properly implemented with relationships
CorePlaylists ← CoreSections ← SectionMedia → Media
     ↓              ↓              ↓
Categories     Order/Type    Selection/Order
```

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Role-based access control** via Clerk admin authentication
- **Published playlist protection** prevents accidental edits
- **Validation at all levels** with Zod schemas and Convex validation
- **Error handling** with proper user feedback

## 📱 Responsive Design

- **Mobile-first approach** with Tailwind CSS 4
- **Touch-friendly interactions** ready for tablet/mobile use
- **Accessible components** using Shadcn UI standards
- **Modern design patterns** following current best practices

## 🎉 Ready for Production

The CorePlaylist builder is now fully functional and ready for:
- Creating and managing playlists
- Adding sections and media content
- Publishing workflows
- Integration with the PWA subscriber app

## 🔄 Next Steps for Full Platform

1. **Connect PWA App**: Use the generated `api.ts` file to connect the subscriber app
2. **Media Player Integration**: Add audio/video playback capabilities
3. **Subscriber Customization**: Build the subscriber playlist customization interface
4. **Analytics Integration**: Add usage tracking and reporting
5. **Mobile App Features**: Implement PWA offline capabilities

The foundation is solid and scalable for the complete Realigna platform! 🚀
